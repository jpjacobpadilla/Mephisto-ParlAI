<h1 align="center">Mephisto-ParlAI</h1>

Welcome to the Mephisto-ParlAI Enhanced project! This repository contains a modified version of the original [Mephisto](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mephisto) project, developed by Facebook Research. Our version extends the functionalities of Mephisto, focusing on flexibility and data management for NLP research. We've integrated features such as storing conversations in a MySQL database, supporting variable conversation lengths, and providing a conversational chatbot fallback when no human participants are available.
